# Understanding-UMAP-vs-tSNE
A unique, 2-hour discussion of the differences between UMAP &amp; TSNE, without going deep into the statistical models and underlying formulae. A publicly available PBMC 1K dataset (analyzed with the Seurat package in R) has been used to illustrate briefly how clustering changes with changes in different parameters. Best clustering and analysis practices were discussed at the conclusion of the session.
